<a href="https://www.ethereum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethereum</a>Â <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intro</a>: Ethereum is a "<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=j23HnORQXvs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world computer</a>", a "<a href="http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/what-is-ethereum.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">programmable blockchain</a>", and a "<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/pull/376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">secure decentralised generalised transaction ledger</a>", that can lower transaction costs for virtually (no pun intended) any transaction or agreement that can be programmed on a computer. For further info you can also read a wiki that I've made <a href="https://github.com/jamesray1/Ethereum-introduction/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

Tasks so far include doing a lot of proofreading while learning about Ethereum and coding, such as (in reverse chronological order) sharding, Viper, Python, <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/sharding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sharding</a>Â code),Â <a href="http://github.com/ethereum/research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a>Â (plus onÂ <a href="http://ethresear.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ethresear.ch</a>Â andÂ <a href="https://gitter.im/ethereum/research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gitter</a>),Â <a href="https://github.com/Ethereum/eips" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EIPs</a>, theÂ <a href="https://github.com/jamesray1/yellowpaper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">yellow paper</a>,Â <a href="https://gist.github.com/Souptacular/fd197b1fac7c6d2660b0bef27a33ed40#lll-and-evm-stack-resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LLL tutorials</a>, theÂ <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white paper,</a>Â andÂ <a href="https://github.com/jamesray1/solidity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solidity</a>.

Intentions: while I am also interested in the innumerable Ethereum smart contract applications and organisations that are possible, e.g. blockchain ðŸ”— electricity âš¡ trading ðŸ“ˆ likeÂ <a href="https://gridplus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grid+</a>, as well as others listed <a href="https://github.com/jamesray1/Ethereum-introduction/wiki/Decentralized-applications-(dapps)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, I think it is more important to continue improving Ethereum, with sharding probably being the most important priority as that will allow more rapid deployment of other improvements or innovations by testing them on shards before they are deployed mainnet. Scalability needs improving, proof-of-work needs to transition to proof-of-stake, and there have been some security issues so that needs to be improved.

While I am also interested in Ethereum applications, particularly blockchain ðŸ”— electricity âš¡ trading ðŸ“ˆ likeÂ <a href="https://gridplus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grid+</a>, I think it is more important to continue developing Ethereum to address issues such as scalability, volatility, security, decentralisation (transitioning away from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake).
