# work-log

My latest work is [Drops of Diamond](https://github.com/Drops-of-Diamond/Diamond-drops), a WIP sharding implementation in Rust.

Here is a [timesheet for Drops of Diamond work](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fv8XqLkMjdBkGPkVWfJulJU-5Qv6TSUR4oD5uKSEHW0/edit?usp=sharing).

I am not an employee or contractor of the Ethereum Foundation.

Here is my [timesheet for Ethereum work](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dDglpWBhWlPyv0tfDntPQc8F-yBsP41wFQnIKgwA068).

For further info you can also read a wiki that I've made <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

Previous and some ongoing tasks include learning [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript), then [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/second-edition), in order to build an implementation of sharding, reading most of the [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.github.io/) specification, doing a lot of proofreading while learning about Ethereum and coding, such as (in reverse chronological order) creating a wiki as an introduction to Ethereum, which as mentioned above is available [here](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-introduction); [Vyper](https://github.com/ethereum/vyper), Python, <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/sharding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sharding</a>,Â <a href="http://github.com/ethereum/research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a>Â (plus onÂ <a href="http://ethresear.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ethresear.ch</a>Â andÂ <a href="https://gitter.im/ethereum/research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gitter</a>),Â <a href="https://github.com/Ethereum/eips" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EIPs</a>, theÂ <a href="https://github.com/jamesray1/yellowpaper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">yellow paper</a>,Â <a href="https://gist.github.com/Souptacular/fd197b1fac7c6d2660b0bef27a33ed40#lll-and-evm-stack-resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LLL tutorials</a>, theÂ <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white paper,</a>Â <a href="https://github.com/jamesray1/solidity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solidity</a>, learning [C++](http://www.learncpp.com/) and ongoing research of dapps. (Now that I listed a whole bunch of programming languages I'll also add that I am proficient in VBA, and know HTML and CSS.

I am also interested in the innumerable Ethereum smart contract applications and organisations that are possible, e.g. blockchain ðŸ”— electricity âš¡ trading ðŸ“ˆ likeÂ <a href="https://gridplus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grid+</a>, as well as others listed <a href="https://github.com/jamesray1/Ethereum-introduction/wiki/Decentralized-applications-(dapps)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. However, I think it is more important to continue improving Ethereum, with [sharding](https://github.com/ethereum/sharding/blob/develop/docs/doc.md) with stateless clients probably being the most important priority as that will allow more rapid deployment of other improvements or innovations by testing them on shards before they are deployed on the main shard. Scalability needs improving, proof-of-work needs to transition to proof-of-stake, and there have been some security issues so that needs to be improved e.g. with better programming languages. There's also volatility (while [Dai coin](https://makerdao.com/) is a possible implementation that can fix this) and a risk of centralization with mining pools, thus the need for proof of stake.

I also <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hodl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hodl</a> Ethereum at <a href="https://etherscan.io/enslookup?q=jamesray.eth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jamesray.eth</a>, although I do regularly check the price due its volatility, and have set up alerts on [Coinwink](https://coinwink.com), and have bought tokens e.g. with dapps listed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Decentralized-apps-(dapps).md), and intend to diversify further. Feel free to send me a donation.
