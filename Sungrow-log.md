Sungrow is the leading global (by capacity of shipments) inverter equipment manufacturer for solar and wind power converters, providing residential, commercial and utility scale inverters, with headquarters in China. Sungrow has shipped over 8 GW of inverter capacity globally so far in 2016.

My achievements include:
	* providing after sales service support through telephone and email—answering and resolving enquiries (e.g. troubleshooting, installation enquiries, monitoring assistance, product enquiries, warranty claims, and other warranty enquiries) from end users, installers, and distributors. Troubleshooting involves asking questions, like an inverter doctor, in order to diagnose the root-cause and fix it, and referring to experience with previous similar situations or our knowledge bank to fix the issue. It might have no display, or it may have a red fault light with a fault code. If it is the latter, I find out what the fault code is. A couple of fault codes indicate that there is a fault with the inverter. Other fault codes could have multiple causes, so diagnosis is required. For instance, fault 010 indicates that there is no connection to the grid. This could be remedied by restarting the inverter; checking whether the circuit breaker is tripping off, and when in relation to inverter operation (e.g. after startup, randomly, or in the middle of the day); and testing the inverter by measuring the voltage internally across the AC terminal.
	* composing and editing documents (including a knowledge bank, editing datasheets and user manuals, troubleshooting for fault codes, user manual extracts; WiFi setting, resetting and FAQs); reviewing the Sungrow website; and proposing an after sales support website, providing feedback on the design, and editing it (yet to be released, still under review) and recording voiceovers for videos;<
 	 * suggesting the development of a website, overseeing it's development by another colleague on Zoho sites, then editing it myself, including adding a bot, more documents, updating and adding links e.g. to surveys and a map that I made of service partners, installers and contractors, and other minor edits / proofreading.
	* training technical support engineers;
	* managing logistics, warehouse and inventory control;
	* liaising with electrical contractors to organise on-site service;
	* providing feedback for existing products and services and for potential growth areas with new product development, such as improvements to the LCD, automatic settings adjustment for certain faults and CT clamp design. More feedback may be available on request.
	* improving efficiency with canned responses in Gmail (later using Zoho with Templates), including Dropbox links (later using Google Drive); data entry with more streamlined spreadsheets (including adding spreadsheets for enquiries that need following up, and feedback spreadsheets); and procuring headsets instead of using a handset for the phones;
	* creating and managing a survey for customers who had their inverter replaced, collecting responses via email and phone, analysing results, and following up on feedback for improvement;
	* investigating requirements from TNSPs & DNSPs for utility scale inverters; and
	* contacting customers of an installer—who is a defendant of a lawsuit; and
	* other research and ad-hoc projects.

Note: I have a timesheet but it may be best not to share it, as it contains info about my remuneration.
